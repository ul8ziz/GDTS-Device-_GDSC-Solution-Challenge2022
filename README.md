# GDTS..Glucose Detector through Skin Device and flutter app.

#GDTS solution: 
 It is a device that measures the level of sugar in the blood, where there is an infrared transmitter and receiver, the transmitter sends the rays that hit the glucose crystals in the blood and are reflected, and here comes the role of the receiving sensor where it receives the reflected signal, the signal is analyzed by the processor and then displays the final results in a screen The presentation also sends it via Bluetooth to the application to display it in the smartphone, instead of painful puzzles or costly slides.
