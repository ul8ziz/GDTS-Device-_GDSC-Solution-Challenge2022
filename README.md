# GDTS-GDSC Solution Challenge 2022:

## GDTS--Glucose Detector through Skin-Device and flutter app.

GDTS solution: 
 It is a device that measures the level of sugar in the blood, where there is an infrared transmitter and receiver, the transmitter sends the rays that hit the glucose crystals in the blood and are reflected, and here comes the role of the receiving sensor where it receives the reflected signal, the signal is analyzed by the processor and then displays the final results in a screen The presentation also sends it via Bluetooth to the application to display it in the smartphone, instead of painful puzzles or costly slides.
 
 ## How to use - following instructions: 
 
1- We operate the device in this way. 

2- We log in to the application. 

3- We connect the application with the device via Bluetooth. 

4- We put the finger in the place of the sensors as shown. 

5- We press the scan button and then wait 5 seconds for the scan process to finish. After that, the result will appear to us. If it is normal, it will show you a stable text,If it is not normal, it will show you unstable. 

6- The application provides a record of the patient's examinations that he previously checked to follow up on the patient's condition.
